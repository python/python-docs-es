"This module provides support for maintaining a list in sorted order without "
"having to sort the list after each insertion.  For long lists of items with "
"expensive comparison operations, this can be an improvement over the more "
"common approach.  The module is called :mod:`bisect` because it uses a basic "
"bisection algorithm to do its work.  The source code may be most useful as a "
"working example of the algorithm (the boundary conditions are already "
"right!)."

"Locate the insertion point for *x* in *a* to maintain sorted order. The "
"parameters *lo* and *hi* may be used to specify a subset of the list which "
"should be considered; by default the entire list is used.  If *x* is already "
"present in *a*, the insertion point will be before (to the left of) any "
"existing entries.  The return value is suitable for use as the first "
"parameter to ``list.insert()`` assuming that *a* is already sorted."

"The returned insertion point *i* partitions the array *a* into two halves so "
