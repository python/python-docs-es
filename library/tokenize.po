"The :mod:`tokenize` module provides a lexical scanner for Python source "
"code, implemented in Python.  The scanner in this module returns comments as "

"To simplify token stream handling, all :ref:`operator <operators>` and :ref:"
"`delimiter <delimiters>` tokens and :data:`Ellipsis` are returned using the "
"generic :data:`~token.OP` token type.  The exact type can be determined by "
"checking the ``exact_type`` property on the :term:`named tuple` returned "
"from :func:`tokenize.tokenize`."

"ints specifying the row and column where the token ends in the source; and "
