"This module adds the ability to import Python modules (:file:`\\*.py`, :file:"
"`\\*.pyc`) and packages from ZIP-format archives. It is usually not needed "
"to use the :mod:`zipimport` module explicitly; it is automatically used by "
"the built-in :keyword:`import` mechanism for :data:`sys.path` items that are "
"paths to ZIP archives."
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/library/zipimport.rst:19
msgid ""
"Typically, :data:`sys.path` is a list of directory names as strings.  This "
"module also allows an item of :data:`sys.path` to be a string naming a ZIP "
"file archive. The ZIP archive can contain a subdirectory structure to "
"support package imports, and a path within the archive can be specified to "
"only import from a subdirectory.  For example, the path :file:`example.zip/"
"lib/` would only import from the :file:`lib/` subdirectory within the "
"archive."

"Any files may be present in the ZIP archive, but only files :file:`.py` and :"

"file:`.py` files, Python will not attempt to modify the archive by adding "
"the corresponding :file:`.pyc` file, meaning that if a ZIP archive doesn't "
"contain :file:`.pyc` files, importing may be rather slow."
