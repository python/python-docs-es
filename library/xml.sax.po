"A typical SAX application uses three kinds of objects: readers, handlers and "
"input sources.  \"Reader\" in this context is another term for parser, i.e. "
"some piece of code that reads the bytes or characters from the input source, "
"and produces a sequence of events. The events then get distributed to the "
"handler objects, i.e. the reader invokes a method on the handler.  A SAX "
"application must therefore obtain a reader object, create or open the input "
"sources, create the handlers, and connect these objects all together.  As "
"the final step of preparation, the reader is called to parse the input. "
"During parsing, methods on the handler objects are called based on "
"structural and syntactic events from the input data."

"For these objects, only the interfaces are relevant; they are normally not "
"instantiated by the application itself.  Since Python does not have an "
"explicit notion of interface, they are formally introduced as classes, but "
"applications may use implementations which do not inherit from the provided "
"classes.  The :class:`~xml.sax.xmlreader.InputSource`, :class:`~xml.sax."

"interfaces are defined in :mod:`xml.sax.handler`.  For convenience, :class:"
