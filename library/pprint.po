"The :mod:`pprint` module provides a capability to \"pretty-print\" arbitrary "
"Python data structures in a form which can be used as input to the "
"interpreter. If the formatted structures include objects which are not "
"fundamental Python types, the representation may not be loadable.  This may "
"be the case if objects such as files, sockets or classes are included, as "
"well as many other objects which are not representable as Python literals."

"Construct a :class:`PrettyPrinter` instance.  This constructor understands "
"several keyword parameters.  An output stream may be set using the *stream* "
"keyword; the only method used on the stream object is the file protocol's :"
"meth:`write` method.  If not specified, the :class:`PrettyPrinter` adopts "
"``sys.stdout``.  The amount of indentation added for each recursive level is "
"specified by *indent*; the default is one.  Other values can cause output to "
"look a little odd, but can make nesting easier to spot.  The number of "
"levels which may be printed is controlled by *depth*; if the data structure "
"being printed is too deep, the next contained level is replaced by ``...``.  "
"By default, there is no constraint on the depth of the objects being "
"formatted.  The desired output width is constrained using the *width* "
"parameter; the default is 80 characters.  If a structure cannot be formatted "
"within the constrained width, a best effort will be made.  If *compact* is "
"false (the default) each item of a long sequence will be formatted on a "
"separate line.  If *compact* is true, as many items as will fit within the "
"*width* will be formatted on each output line. If *sort_dicts* is true (the "
"default), dictionaries will be formatted with their keys sorted, otherwise "
"they will display in insertion order."
