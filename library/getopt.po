"The :mod:`getopt` module is a parser for command line options whose API is "
"designed to be familiar to users of the C :c:func:`getopt` function. Users "
"who are unfamiliar with the C :c:func:`getopt` function or who would like to "
"write less code and get better help and error messages should consider using "
"the :mod:`argparse` module instead."

"This module helps scripts to parse the command line arguments in ``sys."
"argv``. It supports the same conventions as the Unix :c:func:`getopt` "
"function (including the special meanings of arguments of the form '``-``' "
"and '``--``').  Long options similar to those supported by GNU software may "
"be used as well via an optional third argument."

"Parses command line options and parameter list.  *args* is the argument list "
"to be parsed, without the leading reference to the running program. "
"Typically, this means ``sys.argv[1:]``. *shortopts* is the string of option "
"letters that the script wants to recognize, with options that require an "
"argument followed by a colon (``':'``; i.e., the same format that Unix :c:"
"func:`getopt` uses)."

"Unlike GNU :c:func:`getopt`, after a non-option argument, all further "
"arguments are considered also non-options. This is similar to the way non-"
"GNU Unix systems work."

"*longopts*, if specified, must be a list of strings with the names of the "
"long options which should be supported.  The leading ``'--'`` characters "
"should not be included in the option name.  Long options which require an "
"argument should be followed by an equal sign (``'='``).  Optional arguments "
"are not supported.  To accept only long options, *shortopts* should be an "
"empty string.  Long options on the command line can be recognized so long as "
"they provide a prefix of the option name that matches exactly one of the "
"accepted options.  For example, if *longopts* is ``['foo', 'frob']``, the "
"option ``--fo`` will match as ``--foo``, but ``--f`` will not match "
"uniquely, so :exc:`GetoptError` will be raised."

"The return value consists of two elements: the first is a list of ``(option, "
"value)`` pairs; the second is the list of program arguments left after the "
"option list was stripped (this is a trailing slice of *args*).  Each option-"
"and-value pair returned has the option as its first element, prefixed with a "
"hyphen for short options (e.g., ``'-x'``) or two hyphens for long options (e."
"g., ``'--long-option'``), and the option argument as its second element, or "
"an empty string if the option has no argument.  The options occur in the "
"list in the same order in which they were found, thus allowing multiple "
"occurrences.  Long and short options may be mixed."

"This function works like :func:`getopt`, except that GNU style scanning mode "
