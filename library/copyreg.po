"The :mod:`copyreg` module offers a way to define functions used while "
"pickling specific objects.  The :mod:`pickle` and :mod:`copy` modules use "
"those functions when pickling/copying those objects.  The module provides "
"configuration information about object constructors which are not classes. "
"Such constructors may be factory functions or class instances."

"The optional *constructor* parameter, if provided, is a callable object "
