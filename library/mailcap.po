"Mailcap files are used to configure how MIME-aware applications such as mail "
"readers and Web browsers react to files with different MIME types. (The name "
"\"mailcap\" is derived from the phrase \"mail capability\".)  For example, a "
"mailcap file might contain a line like ``video/mpeg; xmpeg %s``.  Then, if "
"the user encounters an email message or Web document with the MIME type :"
"mimetype:`video/mpeg`, ``%s`` will be replaced by a filename (usually one "
"belonging to a temporary file) and the :program:`xmpeg` program can be "
"automatically started to view the file."

"The mailcap format is documented in :rfc:`1524`, \"A User Agent "
"Configuration Mechanism For Multimedia Mail Format Information\", but is not "
"an Internet standard.  However, mailcap files are supported on most Unix "

"Return a 2-tuple; the first element is a string containing the command line "
"to be executed (which can be passed to :func:`os.system`), and the second "
"element is the mailcap entry for a given MIME type.  If no matching MIME "
"type can be found, ``(None, None)`` is returned."

"*key* is the name of the field desired, which represents the type of "
"activity to be performed; the default value is 'view', since in the  most "
"common case you simply want to view the body of the MIME-typed data.  Other "
"possible values might be 'compose' and 'edit', if you wanted to create a new "
"body of the given MIME type or alter the existing body data.  See :rfc:"
"`1524` for a complete list of these fields."

"*filename* is the filename to be substituted for ``%s`` in the command line; "
"the default value is ``'/dev/null'`` which is almost certainly not what you "

"*plist* can be a list containing named parameters; the default value is "
"simply an empty list.  Each entry in the list must be a string containing "
"the parameter name, an equals sign (``'='``), and the parameter's value.  "
"Mailcap entries can contain  named parameters like ``%{foo}``, which will be "
"replaced by the value of the parameter named 'foo'.  For example, if the "
"command line ``showpartial %{id} %{number} %{total}`` was in a mailcap file, "
"and *plist* was set to ``['id=1', 'number=2', 'total=3']``, the resulting "
"command line would be ``'showpartial 1 2 3'``."
