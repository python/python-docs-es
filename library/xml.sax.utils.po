"Similar to :func:`escape`, but also prepares *data* to be used as an "

"additional required replacements. :func:`quoteattr` will select a quote "
"character based on the content of *data*, attempting to avoid encoding any "
"quote characters in the string.  If both single- and double-quote characters "
"are already in *data*, the double-quote characters will be encoded and "
"*data* will be wrapped in double-quotes.  The resulting string can be used "

"This class implements the :class:`~xml.sax.handler.ContentHandler` interface "
"by writing SAX events back into an XML document. In other words, using an :"
"class:`XMLGenerator` as the content handler will reproduce the original "
"document being parsed. *out* should be a file-like object which will default "
"to *sys.stdout*. *encoding* is the encoding of the output stream which "
"defaults to ``'iso-8859-1'``. *short_empty_elements* controls the formatting "
"of elements that contain no content:  if ``False`` (the default) they are "
"emitted as a pair of start/end tags, if set to ``True`` they are emitted as "
"a single self-closed tag."
