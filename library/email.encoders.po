"When creating :class:`~email.message.Message` objects from scratch, you "
"often need to encode the payloads for transport through compliant mail "
"servers. This is especially true for :mimetype:`image/\\*` and :mimetype:"

"The :mod:`email` package provides some convenient encoders in its :mod:"
"`encoders` module.  These encoders are actually used by the :class:`~email."
"mime.audio.MIMEAudio` and :class:`~email.mime.image.MIMEImage` class "
"constructors to provide default encodings.  All encoder functions take "
"exactly one argument, the message object to encode.  They usually extract "
"the payload, encode it, and reset the payload to this newly encoded value.  "
"They should also set the :mailheader:`Content-Transfer-Encoding` header as "
"appropriate."
