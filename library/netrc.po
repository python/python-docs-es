"A :class:`~netrc.netrc` instance or subclass instance encapsulates data "

"file to parse.  If no argument is given, the file :file:`.netrc` in the "
"user's home directory -- as determined by :func:`os.path.expanduser` -- will "
"be read.  Otherwise, a :exc:`FileNotFoundError` exception will be raised. "

"including the file name, line number, and terminating token. If no argument "
"is specified on a POSIX system, the presence of passwords in the :file:`."
"netrc` file will raise a :exc:`NetrcParseError` if the file ownership or "
"permissions are insecure (owned by a user other than the user running the "
"process, or accessible for read or write by any other user). This implements "
