Script to generate the 'dict.txt' dictionary based
on the custom dictionaries under the 'dictionaries/' directory,
but also considering the old words from the 'dict' file.

This was done with:
    awk 1 dict dictionaries/*.txt > dict.txt
but the problem was that windows users, not using Git bash
have the problem that 'awk' is not a valid command, so this
enable them to use the script instead.
