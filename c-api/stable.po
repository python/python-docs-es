"Traditionally, the C API of Python will change with every release.  Most "
"changes will be source-compatible, typically by only adding API, rather than "
"changing existing API or removing API (although some interfaces do get "
"removed after being deprecated first)."

"Unfortunately, the API compatibility does not extend to binary compatibility "
"(the ABI). The reason is primarily the evolution of struct definitions, "
"where addition of a new field, or changing the type of a field, might not "
"break the API, but can break the ABI.  As a consequence, extension modules "
"need to be recompiled for every Python release (although an exception is "
"possible on Unix when none of the affected interfaces are used). In "
"addition, on Windows, extension modules link with a specific pythonXY.dll "
"and need to be recompiled to link with a newer one."

"Since Python 3.2, a subset of the API has been declared to guarantee a "
"stable ABI. Extension modules wishing to use this API (called \"limited API"
"\") need to define ``Py_LIMITED_API``. A number of interpreter details then "
"become hidden from the extension module; in return, a module is built that "
"works on any 3.x version (x>=2) without recompilation."

#: ../Doc/c-api/stable.rst:29
msgid ""
"In some cases, the stable ABI needs to be extended with new functions. "
"Extension modules wishing to use these new APIs need to set "
"``Py_LIMITED_API`` to the ``PY_VERSION_HEX`` value (see :ref:"
"`apiabiversion`) of the minimum Python version they want to support (e.g. "
"``0x03030000`` for Python 3.3). Such modules will work on all subsequent "
"Python releases, but fail to load (because of missing symbols) on the older "
"releases."

"As of Python 3.2, the set of functions available to the limited API is "
"documented in :pep:`384`.  In the C API documentation, API elements that are "
"not part of the limited API are marked as \"Not part of the limited API.\""
