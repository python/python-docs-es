"These APIs are a minimal emulation of the Python 2 C API for built-in file "
"objects, which used to rely on the buffered I/O (:c:type:`FILE\\*`) support "
"from the C standard library.  In Python 3, files and streams use the new :"
"mod:`io` module, which defines several layers over the low-level unbuffered "
"I/O of the operating system.  The functions described below are convenience "
"C wrappers over these new APIs, and meant mostly for internal error "
"reporting in the interpreter; third-party code is advised to access the :mod:"
"`io` APIs instead."

"Create a Python file object from the file descriptor of an already opened "
"file *fd*.  The arguments *name*, *encoding*, *errors* and *newline* can be "
"``NULL`` to use the defaults; *buffering* can be *-1* to use the default. "
"*name* is ignored and kept for backward compatibility. Return ``NULL`` on "
"failure. For a more comprehensive description of the arguments, please refer "
"to the :func:`io.open` function documentation."

"Return the file descriptor associated with *p* as an :c:type:`int`.  If the "
"object is an integer, its value is returned.  If not, the object's :meth:"
"`~io.IOBase.fileno` method is called if it exists; the method must return an "
"integer, which is returned as the file descriptor value.  Sets an exception "

"Equivalent to ``p.readline([n])``, this function reads one line from the "
"object *p*.  *p* may be a file object or any object with a :meth:`~io.IOBase."
"readline` method.  If *n* is ``0``, exactly one line is read, regardless of "
"the length of the line.  If *n* is greater than ``0``, no more than *n* "
"bytes will be read from the file; a partial line can be returned.  In both "
"cases, an empty string is returned if the end of the file is reached "
"immediately.  If *n* is less than ``0``, however, one line is read "
"regardless of length, but :exc:`EOFError` is raised if the end of the file "
"is reached immediately."
