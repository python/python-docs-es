"Because there are no begin/end brackets, Python is much less prone to coding-"
"style conflicts.  In C there are many different ways to place the braces. If "

"Many coding styles place begin/end brackets on a line by themselves.  This "
"makes programs considerably longer and wastes valuable screen space, making "
"it harder to get a good overview of a program.  Ideally, a function should "
"fit on one screen (say, 20--30 lines).  20 lines of Python can do a lot more "
"work than 20 lines of C.  This is not solely due to the lack of begin/end "
"brackets -- the lack of declarations and the high-level data types are also "
"responsible -- but the indentation-based syntax certainly helps."

#: ../Doc/faq/design.rst:97
msgid ""
"One is performance: knowing that a string is immutable means we can allocate "

"tuples and lists."
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/faq/design.rst:102
msgid ""
"Another advantage is that strings in Python are considered as \"elemental\" "

"and in Python, no amount of activity will change the string \"eight\" to "
"anything else."
msgstr ""

msgid "Why must 'self' be used explicitly in method definitions and calls?"
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/faq/design.rst:112
msgid ""
"The idea was borrowed from Modula-3.  It turns out to be very useful, for a "
"variety of reasons."
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/faq/design.rst:115
msgid ""
"First, it's more obvious that you are using a method or instance attribute "
"instead of a local variable.  Reading ``self.x`` or ``self.meth()`` makes it "
"absolutely clear that an instance variable or method is used even if you "
"don't know the class definition by heart.  In C++, you can sort of tell by "
"the lack of a local variable declaration (assuming globals are rare or "
"easily recognizable) -- but in Python, there are no local variable "
"declarations, so you'd have to look up the class definition to be sure.  "
"Some C++ and Java coding standards call for instance attributes to have an "
"``m_`` prefix, so this explicitness is still useful in those languages, too."
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/faq/design.rst:125
msgid ""
"Second, it means that no special syntax is necessary if you want to "
"explicitly reference or call the method from a particular class.  In C++, if "
"you want to use a method from a base class which is overridden in a derived "
"class, you have to use the ``::`` operator -- in Python you can write "
"``baseclass.methodname(self, <argument list>)``.  This is particularly "
"useful for :meth:`__init__` methods, and in general in cases where a derived "
"class method wants to extend the base class method of the same name and thus "
"has to call the base class method somehow."
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/faq/design.rst:134
msgid ""
"Finally, for instance variables it solves a syntactic problem with "
"assignment: since local variables in Python are (by definition!) those "
"variables to which a value is assigned in a function body (and that aren't "
"explicitly declared global), there has to be some way to tell the "
"interpreter that an assignment was meant to assign to an instance variable "
"instead of to a local variable, and it should preferably be syntactic (for "
"efficiency reasons).  C++ does this through declarations, but Python doesn't "
"have declarations and it would be a pity having to introduce them just for "
"this purpose.  Using the explicit ``self.var`` solves this nicely.  "
"Similarly, for using instance variables, having to write ``self.var`` means "
"that references to unqualified names inside a method don't have to search "
"the instance's directories.  To put it another way, local variables and "
"instance variables live in two different namespaces, and you need to tell "
"Python which namespace to use."

"(a) For some operations, prefix notation just reads better than postfix -- "
