"Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming "
"language.  It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high "
"level dynamic data types, and classes.  Python combines remarkable power "
"with very clear syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and "
"libraries, as well as to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C+"
"+.  It is also usable as an extension language for applications that need a "
"programmable interface. Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many Unix "
"variants, on the Mac, and on Windows 2000 and later."

"I had extensive experience with implementing an interpreted language in the "
"ABC group at CWI, and from working with this group I had learned a lot about "
"language design.  This is the origin of many Python features, including the "
"use of indentation for statement grouping and the inclusion of very-high-"

"I had a number of gripes about the ABC language, but also liked many of its "
"features.  It was impossible to extend the ABC language (or its "
"implementation) to remedy my complaints -- in fact its lack of extensibility "
"was one of its biggest problems.  I had some experience with using Modula-2+ "
"and talked with the designers of Modula-3 and read the Modula-3 report. "

"some other Python features."

"I was working in the Amoeba distributed operating system group at CWI.  We "
"needed a better way to do system administration than by writing either C "
"programs or Bourne shell scripts, since Amoeba had its own system call "
"interface which wasn't easily accessible from the Bourne shell.  My "
"experience with error handling in Amoeba made me acutely aware of the "
"importance of exceptions as a programming language feature."
msgstr ""

#: ../Doc/faq/general.rst:92
msgid ""
"It occurred to me that a scripting language with a syntax like ABC but with "
"access to the Amoeba system calls would fill the need.  I realized that it "
"would be foolish to write an Amoeba-specific language, so I decided that I "
"needed a language that was generally extensible."

#: ../Doc/faq/general.rst:97

"During the 1989 Christmas holidays, I had a lot of time on my hand, so I "
"decided to give it a try.  During the next year, while still mostly working "

"success, and the feedback from colleagues made me add many early "
