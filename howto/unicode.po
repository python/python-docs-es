"Today's programs need to be able to handle a wide variety of characters.  "
"Applications are often internationalized to display messages and output in a "
"variety of user-selectable languages; the same program might need to output "
"an error message in English, French, Japanese, Hebrew, or Russian.  Web "
"content can be written in any of these languages and can also include a "
"variety of emoji symbols. Python's string type uses the Unicode Standard for "

"different possible characters."

"A **character** is the smallest possible component of a text.  'A', 'B', "

"example, there's a character for \"Roman Numeral One\", 'Ⅰ', that's separate "

"To summarize the previous section: a Unicode string is a sequence of code "

"This sequence of code points needs to be represented in memory as a set of "

"It's very wasteful of space.  In most texts, the majority of the code points "

"``0x00`` bytes.  The above string takes 24 bytes compared to the 6 bytes "
"needed for an ASCII representation.  Increased RAM usage doesn't matter too "

"The Unicode character ``U+FEFF`` is used as a byte-order mark (BOM), and is "
"often written as the first character of a file in order to assist with "
"autodetection of the file's byte ordering.  Some encodings, such as UTF-16, "
"expect a BOM to be present at the start of a file; when such an encoding is "
"used, the BOM will be automatically written as the first character and will "
"be silently dropped when the file is read.  There are variants of these "
"encodings, such as 'utf-16-le' and 'utf-16-be' for little-endian and big-"
"endian encodings, that specify one particular byte ordering and don't skip "
"the BOM."

"In some areas, it is also convention to use a \"BOM\" at the start of UTF-8 "
"encoded files; the name is misleading since UTF-8 is not byte-order "
"dependent. The mark simply announces that the file is encoded in UTF-8.  For "
"reading such files, use the 'utf-8-sig' codec to automatically skip the mark "
"if present."

"Most of the operating systems in common use today support filenames that "

"converting the Unicode string into some encoding that varies depending on "
"the system.  Today Python is converging on using UTF-8: Python on MacOS has "
"used UTF-8 for several versions, and Python 3.6 switched to using UTF-8 on "
"Windows as well.  On Unix systems, there will only be a filesystem encoding "
"if you've set the ``LANG`` or ``LC_CTYPE`` environment variables; if you "
"haven't, the default encoding is again UTF-8."

"you pass a Unicode string as the path, filenames will be decoded using the "
"filesystem's encoding and a list of Unicode strings will be returned, while "
"passing a byte path will return the filenames as bytes.  For example, "

"If you attempt to write processing functions that accept both Unicode and "

"When using data coming from a web browser or some other untrusted source, a "
"common technique is to check for illegal characters in a string before using "
"the string in a generated command line or storing it in a database.  If "
"you're doing this, be careful to check the decoded string, not the encoded "
"bytes data; some encodings may have interesting properties, such as not "
"being bijective or not being fully ASCII-compatible.  This is especially "
"true if the input data also specifies the encoding, since the attacker can "
"then choose a clever way to hide malicious text in the encoded bytestream."
