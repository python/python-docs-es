"`The Linux perf profiler <https://perf.wiki.kernel.org>`_ is a very powerful "
"tool that allows you to profile and obtain information about the performance "
"of your application. ``perf`` also has a very vibrant ecosystem of tools "
"that aid with the analysis of the data that it produces."

"The main problem with using the ``perf`` profiler with Python applications "
"is that ``perf`` only gets information about native symbols, that is, the "
"names of functions and procedures written in C. This means that the names "
"and file names of Python functions in your code will not appear in the "
"output of ``perf``."

"Since Python 3.12, the interpreter can run in a special mode that allows "
"Python functions to appear in the output of the ``perf`` profiler. When this "
"mode is enabled, the interpreter will interpose a small piece of code "
"compiled on the fly before the execution of every Python function and it "
"will teach ``perf`` the relationship between this piece of code and the "
"associated Python function using :doc:`perf map files <../c-api/perfmaps>`."

"Support for the ``perf`` profiler is currently only available for Linux on "
"select architectures. Check the output of the ``configure`` build step or "

"As you can see, the Python functions are not shown in the output, only "
"``_Py_Eval_EvalFrameDefault`` (the function that evaluates the Python "
"bytecode) shows up. Unfortunately that's not very useful because all Python "
"functions use the same C function to evaluate bytecode so we cannot know "
"which Python function corresponds to which bytecode-evaluating function."

"For best results, Python should be compiled with ``CFLAGS=\"-fno-omit-frame-"
"pointer -mno-omit-leaf-frame-pointer\"`` as this allows profilers to unwind "
"using only the frame pointer and not on DWARF debug information. This is "
"because as the code that is interposed to allow ``perf`` support is "
"dynamically generated it doesn't have any DWARF debugging information "
"available."
