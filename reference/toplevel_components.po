"The Python interpreter can get its input from a number of sources: from a "
"script passed to it as standard input or as program argument, typed in "
"interactively, from a module source file, etc.  This chapter gives the "
"syntax used in these cases."

"While a language specification need not prescribe how the language "
"interpreter is invoked, it is useful to have a notion of a complete Python "
"program.  A complete Python program is executed in a minimally initialized "
"environment: all built-in and standard modules are available, but none have "
"been initialized, except for :mod:`sys` (various system services), :mod:"
"`builtins` (built-in functions, exceptions and ``None``) and :mod:"
"`__main__`.  The latter is used to provide the local and global namespace "
"for execution of the complete program."

"The interpreter may also be invoked in interactive mode; in this case, it "
"does not read and execute a complete program but reads and executes one "
"statement (possibly compound) at a time.  The initial environment is "
"identical to that of a complete program; each statement is executed in the "
"namespace of :mod:`__main__`."

"A complete program can be passed to the interpreter in three forms: with "
"the :option:`-c` *string* command line option, as a file passed as the first "
"command line argument, or as standard input.  If the file or standard input "
"is a tty device, the interpreter enters interactive mode; otherwise, it "
"executes the file as a complete program."
